## General info
Recent advances in natural language processing have been adopted widely in various fields and products. Natural language generation in particular has been used to display real-time predictive text while typing on QWERTY keypads, search engines, and even email. In this project, we utilize recent progress on topic specific language generation to develop a proof of concept implementation of a word processor with predictive capabilities. We also present a heuristic evaluation of our system, and propose modifications based on user feedback we gathered.
